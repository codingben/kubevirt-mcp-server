# TODO - KubeVirt MCP Server Improvements

This document tracks potential improvements and future features for the KubeVirt MCP server project.

## High Priority

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Add VM restart functionality to MCP tools
- [ ] Implement VM instance type modification tool
- [ ] Add VM status filtering in resource handlers (running, stopped, etc.)
- [ ] Add label-based filtering for VM and VMI resources
- [ ] Implement VM cloning/template functionality

### Error Handling & Validation
- [ ] Improve error messages with more specific context
- [ ] Add input validation for VM names (Kubernetes naming rules)
- [ ] Add namespace existence validation before operations
- [ ] Implement retry logic for transient Kubernetes API errors

### Security & Authentication
- [ ] Add proper RBAC validation for operations
- [ ] Implement service account token handling
- [ ] Add namespace access control validation
- [ ] Consider adding audit logging for operations

## Medium Priority

### Resource Management
- [ ] Add VM disk management tools (attach/detach volumes)
- [ ] Implement VM network interface management
- [ ] Add VM snapshot creation and management
- [ ] Support for VM migration between nodes
- [ ] Add VM resource usage metrics (CPU, memory, storage)

### User Experience
- [ ] Add VM console access capabilities
- [ ] Implement VM event streaming/monitoring
- [ ] Add bulk operations (start/stop multiple VMs)
- [ ] Provide VM scheduling and lifecycle management
- [ ] Add VM backup and restore functionality

### Performance & Scalability
- [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed resources
- [ ] Add pagination support for large VM lists
- [ ] Optimize Kubernetes API calls with field selectors
- [ ] Add connection pooling for KubeVirt client

## Low Priority

### Development & Tooling
- [ ] Add integration tests with real KubeVirt cluster
- [ ] Implement mock KubeVirt client for testing
- [ ] Add benchmarking tests for performance monitoring
- [ ] Create Docker/container image for deployment
- [ ] Add Helm chart for Kubernetes deployment

### Documentation & Examples
- [ ] Create detailed API documentation
- [ ] Add usage examples for each MCP tool and resource
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Add architecture documentation with diagrams
- [ ] Create deployment guide for different environments

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Add structured logging with levels
- [ ] Implement metrics collection (Prometheus compatible)
- [ ] Add health check endpoints
- [ ] Create dashboard for monitoring server status
- [ ] Add distributed tracing support

## Future Considerations

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Support for VM GPU passthrough management
- [ ] Implement VM auto-scaling based on metrics
- [ ] Add multi-cluster support
- [ ] Integration with CI/CD pipelines for VM management
- [ ] Support for VM templating and golden images

### Integration
- [ ] Add support for other virtualization platforms
- [ ] Integrate with cloud provider VM services
- [ ] Add support for bare metal provisioning
- [ ] Integration with configuration management tools

## Technical Debt

### Code Quality
- [ ] Add more comprehensive test coverage (target >80%)
- [ ] Implement proper dependency injection
- [ ] Add interface abstractions for better testability
- [ ] Refactor large functions into smaller, focused ones
- [ ] Add comprehensive API documentation with examples

### Architecture
- [ ] Consider implementing plugin architecture for extensibility
- [ ] Add configuration file support for server settings
- [ ] Implement graceful shutdown handling
- [ ] Add request/response middleware support
- [ ] Consider adding API versioning strategy
